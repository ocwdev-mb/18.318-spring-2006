A paper of 6-12 pages related to algebraic combinatorics is due on the last class. The paper should be printed in some flavor of TeX (e.g., LaTeX). It is strongly recommended that all figures be drawn with some graphics package (such as xfig) that can be incorporated into LaTeX, the reason being that knowing how to do this will prove invaluable for your future career.

The paper need not have any original mathematics, but it should consist of more than paraphrasing from a single source. There should be a bibliography with at least two references. You can choose any topic related to algebraic combinatorics, but your topic needs to be approved in advance. In particular, the paper must involve some algebra (linear algebra, groups, rings, fields, ...). Therefore please let me know (in person or by email) your proposed paper topic. Include a couple of sentences about what material you plan to cover.

Some suggestions for paper topics, along with ideas for sources:

Combinatorial Commutative Algebra
---------------------------------

Stanley, Richard P. _Combinatorics and Commutative Algebra_. 2nd ed. Boston, MA: Birkhäuser, 1996. ISBN: 0817638369 and 3764338369.

Miller, Ezra, and Bernd Sturmfels. _Combinatorial Commutative Algebra_. New York, NY: Springer, c2005. ISBN: 0387223568.

My book _Combinatorics and Commutative Algebra_ has many possible topics, as does _Combinatorial Commutative Algebra_ by Miller and Sturmfels.

Topological Combinatorics (For those Who Know Some Algebraic Topology)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The article "Topological methods" by Anders Björner in _Handbook of Combinatorics_, vol. 2, pp. 1819-1872, is a good place to get started.

Linear Algebra and Combinatorics
--------------------------------

[![Buy at MIT Press](/images/mp_logo.gif)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/0262071711) Graham, R. L., M. Grötschel, and L. Lovász, eds. [_Handbook of Combinatorics_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/0262071711). Vol. 2. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1995. ISBN: 0262071711.

See the articles "Tools from linear algebra" by C. D. Godsil, pp. 1707-1748, and "Tools from higher algebra" by Noga Alon, pp. 1749-1783, in _Handbook of Combinatorics_, vol. 2.

Graph Eigenvalues
-----------------

Cvetković, Dragoš M. _Spectra of Graphs: Theory and Application_. 3rd ed. Edited by Dragoš M. Cvetković, Michael Doob, and Horst Sachs. New York, NY: Academic Press, 1979. ISBN: 0121951502.

Biggs, Norman, ed. _Algebraic Graph Theory_. 2nd ed. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1993. ISBN: 0521458978.

A huge topic. The book _Spectra of Graphs_, 3rd ed., by Cvetkovic, Doob, and Sachs will get you into the literature. The book _Algebraic Graph Theory_ by Biggs also has a lot of information.

Tilings
-------

Stein, Sherman K. _Algebra and Tiling: Homomorphisms in the Service of Geometry_. Edited by Sherman K. Stein and Sándor Szabó. Washington, DC: Mathematical Association of America, 1994. ISBN: 0883850281.

See _Algebra and Tiling_ by S. K. Stein and S. Szabó. I hope to cover some of these topics in class.

Combinatorics and Symmetry
--------------------------

This includes such topics as permutation groups, association schemes, block designs, and codes. See Chapters 12-16 in _Handbook of Combinatorics_, vol. 1.
